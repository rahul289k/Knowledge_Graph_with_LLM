# Knowledge_Graph_with_LLM
This initiative aims to develop a Knowledge Graph (KG) integrated with a Large Language Model (LLM) to enable intelligent search, reasoning, and discovery. The KG will unify key entities from company's data systems, such as companies, industries, skills, job roles, job families, salaries, courses, and people. Leveraging the companyâ€™s taxonomy and ontologies (e.g., skills, job roles, and company headquarters), it will provide a consistent structure for datasets like Job Descriptions (JDs), Profiles, Courses, News, and Salaries.

The LLM's natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities will allow users to query the graph using plain language and receive context-aware, actionable insights. This system will support low-latency, real-time conceptual and structural search, enabling advanced deductive reasoning and discovery. By integrating the KG with the LLM, users can generate detailed reports and access deep insights to boost productivity and decision-making for the company and its customers.

Future enhancements include incorporating machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to enable advanced predictions, role recommendations, and pattern detection and alerts on new addition in any entity.
