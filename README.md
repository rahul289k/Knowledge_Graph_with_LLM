# Knowledge_Graph_with_LLM
This initiative builds a Knowledge Graph (KG) with a Large Language Model (LLM) for advanced search and reasoning. The KG integrates entities like companies, skills, roles, and salaries using unified taxonomies. It enables plain language queries, insightful reports, and future capabilities like predictions and recommendations.
